<!-- ## Description -->
   - This is a cpp project to maintain a hospital system.

   - ADMIN maintains all the data, doctors can give tests to the patients under him.

   - And SUPER ADMIN maintains all data including admin data also. New Admin has to add from the super admin part. Super Admin creattion and deletion have to do manually from the _super_admin.txt_ file.

   - The system uses **.txt** files to store the information of people (doctors, patients, nurses, admin).

   - There are archive files for all of the users, that keep the details of the persons who were in the hospital.
      _As an example: previous doctors, past patients, previous nurses._
   - Doctors have their own secure profile, that also shows the patients under them.

   - Users as a patient can search for patient information by giving patient ID.

   - There is an auto ID generator for doctors, patients, and nurses. The patient also gets a room number automatically.
